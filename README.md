# Heart-Disease-Prediction--ML-supervised
I have created this machine learning model using Logistic Regression that will predict whether a person have a heart disease or not on the basis of certain factors like cholestrol, age ,fbs etc.
The libraries used in the particular project are-
numpy,pandas and sklearn.
